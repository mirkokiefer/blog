We released LivelyNotes 1.1! Its been a huge step compared to [version 1.0](/blog/2014/04/getting-to-livelynotes-1-0) - we could have well called it 2.0.  
The biggest thing we added is **tasks**. You can now manage both your text notes and tasks related to a project.  
We spent a lot of time trying out different ways to manage these two item types.
How to quickly add either a note or a task from the start screen? How to visually present them in projects?

We finally came up with this slick start screen:

It allows you to quickly add new notes, create new projects or rearrange and archive projects.  
Yes, **archiving** is another feature we find really useful. Once you have finished a project, you can now archive it.
It will then appear in the *Archive* section and can always be restored or permanently deleted.

But lets have a look at how tasks show up in a projects detail screen:

We have split the project screen into a tasks and notes section. When I start out in a project, the goals are often still vague and it helps to first write down some thoughts and ideas. Once I got a clear picture I extract the next tasks out of my notes.  
I find it extremely helpful not being forced to immediately write down an actionable task. In pure task managers I used in the past, I often cluttered my projects with 'tasks' which were often just vague ideas.  
The section headers for tasks and notes stick to the top as you scroll down. So you don't have to scroll up again to create notes.  
We also added a button to hide and show finished tasks.

The actual task view is quite simple - just a title and an optional due date:

We have some nice visual indicators for the checkbox - orange for due tasks, red for overdue tasks.
In the list of projects we show you the number of due tasks as well. This way you can see at a glance which projects have priority.  
We are working on a much more powerful way to see whats next up and what you have worked on in the last days. But more on that in the next post...

One final feature, I don't want to miss is **search**. Thanks to the Apple frameworks, this one was almost trivial to implement. Search is super fast and works across all projects.

This release brought us quite a few downloads. LivelyNotes has become an essential tool for me every day - I currently use it to manage about 20 projects, including hundreds of tasks and notes.

This is how LivelyNotes looks for me today:

Our focus for the last weeks was to get a limited version of LivelyNotes for Mac to a usable state. We want to have at least a minimal version for the Mac so that we can start learning about the typical workflows we need to optimize for.
We are really happy with our iterative approach for the iPhone. If we wouldn't have been able to use LivelyNotes from week one, it would not nearly have become as good.  
We do now have a usable Mac version and will test it in the next weeks.  
But before we release it, we still want to do at least two large feature releases for the iPhone.
I will write more about it in the next post.
