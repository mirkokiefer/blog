There is hardly any other programming language that is as little understood as Javascript but still as widely used. Douglas Crockford made a good point on saying that everybody believes he can use Javascript without actually learning it.

Until today there are very few applications written entirely in Javascript. Google tries to change that with Google Web Toolkit which allows writing entire webapps in Java and compiling them to pure Javascript.
For many developers this has the benefit of staying with a language and development environment they are used to.

Why is everyone trying to get around writing code in Javascript itself? Until recently I belonged to the same crowd, avoiding to write Javascript as long as possible and if unavoidable just copying and pasting some promising scripts from the web. Somehow Javascript got the image of being a “toy language” that “serious developers” don’t rely on.

But think about it for a second. If there is one language that we will have to rely on for the foreseeable future it is going to be Javascript. Nobody would seriously expect to see a stop of the internet’s growth anytime soon. Nobody can seriously hope that whats called a “webbrowser” will disappear as the gatekeeper to the web on everyones computer. And as Javascript is the only language that runs in a webbrowser, knowing this language in detail is a good investment in a developer’s future.

I will myself get started with Javascript in the next weeks and regularly post enlightenments here.
