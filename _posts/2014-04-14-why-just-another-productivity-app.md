This is what the productivity app space looks like on the iPhone. A ton of task management apps at varying levels of complexity.
Still, Johannes and I got very frustrated by not being able to find a single productivity app that fulfills our simple set of needs.
Tasks very often start with some unstructured notes. Be it during a meeting, a phone call or on the go. We do not always have the time to write down a precise list of tasks from the top of our head. So the app has to support **quick capture of plain text notes**.  
It should always be possible to add details to notes and to **translate notes into tasks**.  
There needs to be a simple way to **organize notes and tasks in projects**.  
We want to be able to **attach files and photos** to notes.  
The app needs to work at least on the **iPhone and Mac**.  
It should synchronize our data via **iCloud** so we **don't have to create another account**.  
The app should be **paid for once** - so no monthly premium plans.
{more}

Given these features we do not know of any app in the iPhone or OSX AppStore.
Notes are often very personal - so we would be much more comfortable with all **notes being encrypted** on our devices before being sent to iCloud. That way no one else could access them, even if there would be a security breach in iCloud or Apple would somehow be forced to release user data.

So thats why [Johannes](/blog/2014/04/announcing-livelycode) and I decided to join forces and develop a note-taking app we both will love to use. We call it **LivelyNotes**!  
Check out our next post where we reflect on how we stripped down our vision to the bare minimum and actually released [LivelyNotes 1.0](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/livelynotes/id769528108?mt=8) to users.
