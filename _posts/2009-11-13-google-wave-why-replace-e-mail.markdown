I finally got a Google Wave Developer account and will have a closer look at the project during the next weeks.

The idea behind Google Wave is to reinvent e-mail the way it would look like when invented today. Instead of using plain and static text/html messages, people communicate in a much more dynamic way on the web today.

When communicating with friends e-mail is hardly used anymore. Services like Facebook or Twitter allow a much more lightweight way of sending messages and make it easier to interact with multiple people. In your e-mail account you have no real way to filter incoming messages on their context. No matter if you are interested in an e-mail you are going to get it into your postbox. In e-mail you can not define the social environment you want to communicate in. You can not define a group of people you want to get started on a discussion. Of course you can set up mailing lists, of course you can CC mails to many people – but its tedious. You do not have a simple way to follow a certain conversation. In Facebook you can choose your Friends, in Twitter you choose whom to follow. Gmail is already going into the direction of leveraging e-mail by grouping messages to threads – but even Gmail can only guess which mails belong to what conversation by looking at the sender and subject. What if someone wants to add comments to earlier discussions? He would have to first look up that old mail, copy the relevant part of the message and paste it into a new mail – the whole context is lost. The receiver of that mail would probably have to look up the old mails, as well, to find relevant parts of the earlier discussion.  
Most social networks sites also allow a seamless switch between simple message sending and live chat. This is not possible in e-mail either – you would have to run a chat tool in addition. This works but what if you want to continue a discussion from an e-mail in live chat? You can not track this discussion in a continuous way – you have to check both, your old mails and your chat log.  
Finally there is Google Docs which is a great way of collaboratively working on documents – even in real-time and with the option to track all changes anyone made. This is an incredible improvement on the traditional way of sending around documents, let everyone make their changes, send them back, integrate all those changes, send it out again….

In my eyes these are the main drivers behind Google Wave – ease of communication, interacting with multiple people, switching between message sending and live communication, collaboratively editing and reviewing changes.
