We wanted to be able to use a first version of our note-taking app as fast as possible.
So we decided to focus only on taking plain text notes.
No tasks, no attachments, no photos and definitely no encryption.
We also picked the iPhone as our first target platform.
Eventually merging both note-taking and task management into an integrated app is a challenging task. But it will be much more challening to do on the limited screen of a mobile device than on a Mac.
So by starting with mobile we will avoid adding features that will simply not work on an iPhone screen.

Our goal for the first version is to just be a step ahead of the built-in Notes app on the iPhone:

Apple's Notes app lacks any features for organizing notes. So LivelyNotes 1.0 will allow you to group your notes in projects.
We further add a sharing feature for notes, that allows you to quickly send your notes as emails, share them via Facebook etc...
Crucial for us to be able to use the app was a simple note export feature. While working on the app we delete and re-install the app all the time - so we need to be able to easily backup all our notes.
Most users will probably not use this feature frequently  - but we think all apps should give the user a simple way to get all their data out.

Taking this app from idea to AppStore submission took us less than four weeks of part-time work. We are quite happy with the result:
