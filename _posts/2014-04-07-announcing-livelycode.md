[Johannes Auer](https://github.com/johannesauer) and I are both from the beautiful city of [Heidelberg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heidelberg), in the south of Germany. We have been good friends for years and worked together on various side-projects.
Johannes is raising his twins while finishing his computer science degree at the University of Heidelberg. He does freelance work building iOS apps from time to time if he is not working on his [own programming language implementation](https://github.com/lamda-lang/hyde).

A few months back we incorporated [LivelyCode](http://livelycode.com/) to publish our latest side-project - LivelyNotes, an exciting productivity app.
We have been working on LivelyNotes in our spare time since November 2013. Getting to where we are with the app now, was a lot of work going through multiple iterations. Trying out ideas, embracing some and throwing away many others...
We managed to release a first version with the bare essentials after just three weeks (working on it 2-3  evenings a week). Its available as [LivelyNotes 1.0](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/livelynotes/id769528108?mt=8) on the iPhone AppStore.
I will follow up with detailed posts about what motivated us to build LivelyNotes and the many iterations we went through already.
