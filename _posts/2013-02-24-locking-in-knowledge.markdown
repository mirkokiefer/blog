I hate it when I have to do extra work to publish and link to things I create on my local computer.<!-- more -->

When I create notes and mark things in my PDF reader I want it to be instantly visible on the web. Same is true when working with any native app that allows me to create stuff.

The power of the web comes from the ability to link things - I can't link things inside desktop apps from the web!

Desktop apps are great for usability but they need to become a lot more open and connected.
